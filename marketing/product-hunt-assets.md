## First Comment (Maker's Comment)

Hey Product Hunt!

I'm [Name], founder of BotFlow. I built this because I saw South African small businesses struggling with two things:

1. **The WhatsApp problem**: Everyone uses WhatsApp for business here, but there's no affordable way to automate responses without losing the personal touch.

2. **The pricing problem**: Most automation tools are in USD, don't support our payment methods, and aren't built with our market in mind.

BotFlow solves both. We offer three services that work together or standalone:
- AI Assistant for intelligent business answers
- WhatsApp automation with easy QR onboarding
- Receipt scanning that actually understands SA invoices

We're priced in Rands, support Paystack, and are fully POPIA compliant.

We're launching with a special for Product Hunters: **20% off your first 3 months** with code PRODUCTHUNT.

Would love your feedback and happy to answer any questions!
