We're officially launching BotFlow today! 🎉

Here's the problem we're solving 🧵

South African SMEs spend 20+ hours/week on:
- Responding to WhatsApp messages
- Manually entering receipt data
- Searching for business information

It doesn't have to be this way...

## LinkedIn - Founder Announcement

```
I'm thrilled to announce the launch of BotFlow – an AI-powered automation platform built specifically for South African businesses.

After 2 years of building and learning from local SMEs, we've created a solution that addresses three major pain points:

1️⃣ **WhatsApp Overwhelm**
Every SA business uses WhatsApp, but most struggle to keep up with messages. Our WhatsApp Assistant automates responses 24/7, without requiring you to change your phone number.

2️⃣ **Receipt Chaos**
Manual receipt entry is tedious and error-prone. Our AI-powered Receipt Assistant scans and extracts data automatically, saving hours every week.

3️⃣ **Information Overload**
Need quick answers about your business? Our AI Assistant gives you instant insights, drafts responses, and helps with decision-making.

What makes us different:
• Prices in Rands (R99-R899/month)
• Pay with Paystack
• POPIA compliant
• Setup in 5 minutes

We're offering a 14-day free trial with a 14-day money-back guarantee because we believe in the product that much.

If you're a South African business owner looking to automate and scale, I'd love to hear from you.
